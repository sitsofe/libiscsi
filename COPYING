Libiscsi components fall under two separate licences


The lib and include directories
===============================
The iscsi client library itself, i.e. the lib and include directories,
is licenced under GNU Lesser General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

The library also contains one file : lib/md5.c that is under Public Domain.

A copy of LGPL 2.1 is included in the file LICENCE-LGPL-2.1.txt but can also be downloaded from http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html

This is the licence that applies to the libiscsi library and its use.



The src and examples directories
================================
The utility and example applications using this library, i.e. the src and the
examples directories, are licenced under the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the
License, or (at your option) any later version.

These are executable applications that link with the libiscsi library.

A copy of GPL 2 is included in the file LICENCE-GPL-2.txt but can also be downloaded from http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html

This licence applies only to the source code for the provided applications that link to and use libiscsi.



To avoid any confusion, every source file also contain a licence boilerplate.
